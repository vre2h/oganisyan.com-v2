It's almost 2022, but:
  â€” we still don't have adequate approaches that the community agrees regarding state management;

  â€” there are a lot of options for conditional rendering, but each of them is a compromise;

  â€” JSX is a nightmare;

  â€” it's just slow. Maybe examples from their documentation page are working fast, but whenever someone starts to work on something a little bit more complex, react starts to create problems for you;

  â€” seems like all form libraries in the ecosystem have been created to make the DX as awful as possible.

P.S. Spoiler: other frameworks arenâ€™t better.

P.P.S. In the meantime, I'm looking for middle and senior React and Node.js Developers.

P.P.P.S. It's the first post of the series of "ðŸ˜ˆ Unpopular opinions" where I'm making statements most people don't agree with and trying not to read/write comments.
