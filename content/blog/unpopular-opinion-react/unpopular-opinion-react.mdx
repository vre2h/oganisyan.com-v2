It's almost 2022, but:
— we still don't have adequate approaches that the community agrees regarding state management;
— there are a lot of options for conditional rendering, but each of them is a compromise;
— JSX is a nightmare;
— it's just slow. Maybe examples from their documentation page are working fast, but whenever someone starts to work on something a little bit more complex, react starts to create problems for you;
— seems like all form libraries in the ecosystem have been created to make the DX as awful as possible.

P.S. Spoiler: other frameworks aren’t better.

P.P.S. In the meantime, I'm looking for middle and senior React and Node.js Developers.

P.P.P.S. It's the first post of the series of "Unpopular opinions" where I'm making statements most people don't agree with and trying not to read/write comments.
