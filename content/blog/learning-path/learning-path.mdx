As a lifelong learner and explorer, I noticed similar patterns in
studying and mastering skills among my students, mentees, and colleagues.
I divided the learning path into 5 levels: from newbie to expert.

_Note_, all numbers are relative and are subject to change.

## Level 1 <ColoredTag>Newby</ColoredTag>

People, who heard about the skills, and profession but have no idea how
hard it's going to be and how to learn stuff. During this period, people
don't have any valuable information. But if they are interested, it's really easy to jump into the next round.

| Learning time | Information Source               | Cases |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ----- |
| 0-1 month     | Gossips, Youtube recommendations | 0     |

## Level 2 <ColoredTag>Beginner</ColoredTag>

If the interest was high enough then one might decide to dive deeper
and find some books or courses. During this period, it's very important
to find the right courses or mentors to follow, give plenty of time to learning to learning
and start completing as many projects as possible.

And if your desire is strong enough to get through the difficulties, you become
specialist and start earning money with the skills you have.

| Learning time | Information Source      | Cases                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 6-12 months   | Courses, Books, Mentors | A few educational projects, maybe 1 real life project |

### Dunning-Kruger Effect for Beginners

Many people stop improving during this stage because they believe they know enough.
That's where they stop getting better and
stuck on the same job for 30 years.

> The Dunning-Kruger effect is a type of cognitive bias in which people believe they are smarter and more capable than they are. Essentially, low-ability people do not possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence.

## Level 3 <ColoredTag>Specialist</ColoredTag>

During this period, people already understand the field, what they are capable of.
They usually can prepare roadmap with the help of mentor and execute it.
Most of people earn enough money and can afford themselves to retire from _growth_
(which is completely okay. Please, don't torture yourself).

_Note,_

- Some people reach this stage too quickly without rest and get burned out.
- Only a few percent of people continues to give enough time and energy to become master.

| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 2-5 years     | Confs, Professional literature, Colleagues, Mentors | 3-10  |

## Level 4 <ColoredTag>Master</ColoredTag>

Masters are wise enough to start making projects with the help of other people (their team),
they have enough skills in the field and starting to become better as managers.

A lot of masters become managers and don't use their skills directly, but help other people to get better.
