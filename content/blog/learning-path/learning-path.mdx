studying and mastering skills among my students, mentees and colleagues.
I divided learning path into 5 levels: from newby to expert.

_Note_, all numbers are relative and are subject of change.

## Level 1 <ColoredTag>Newby</ColoredTag>

People, who listened about the skills, profession but have no idea how
hard it's going to be and how to learn stuff. In this period, people
don't have any valuable information. But if they interested, it's really easy to jump into the next round.

## Level 2 <ColoredTag>Beginner</ColoredTag>

If the interest was high enough then one might decide to dive deeper
and find some books or courses. During this period, it's very important
to find right courses or mentors to follow, give a lot of time to learning

specialist and start earning money with the skills you have.
