## The Course

Recently I've completed 4-month long journey of becoming Google
Certified Professional in Project Management. It was both challenging
and rewarding. I learned a lot about Management History, Practices, and Frameworks.

Here is the complete review of the certification process ðŸ‘‡

## Course Structure

The certification consists of 6 different sub courses:

1. <b>Foundations of Project Management</b>

   This course is the first in a series of six to equip you with the skills
   you need to apply to introductory-level roles in project management.

2. <b>Project Initiation: Starting a Successfull Project</b>

   This course will show you how to set a project up for success in the
   first phase of the project life cycle: the project initiation phase.
   In exploring the key components of this phase, youâ€™ll learn how to define
   and manage project goals, deliverables, scope, and success criteria.

3. <b>Project Planning: Putting it All Together</b>

   This course will explore how to map out a project in the second phase
   of the project life cycle: the project planning phase. You will examine
   the key components of a project plan, how to make accurate time estimates,
   and how to set milestones.

4. <b>Project Execution: Running the Project</b>

   This course will delve into the execution and closing phases of the project life cycle. You
   will learn what aspects of a project to track and how to track them.
   You will also learn how to effectively manage and communicate changes,
   dependencies, and risks.

5. <b>Agile Project Management. Scrum</b>

   This course will explore the history, approach, and philosophy of Agile
   project management, including the Scrum framework. You will learn how
   to differentiate and blend Agile and other project management approaches.
   As you progress through the course, you will learn more about Scrum,
   exploring its pillars and values and comparing essential Scrum team
   roles.

6. <b>Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World</b>

   > The
   > hardest one to pass. This one consists of 8 peer-graded assignments
   > where you are going to set up the project from the idea till the closing
   > surveys and presentations.

   By the end of this course, you will have developed a portfolio of project management artifacts that will demonstrate the skills you have learned throughout the entire program, such as your ability to manage stakeholders and teams, organize plans, and communicate project details.
