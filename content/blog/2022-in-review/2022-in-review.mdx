## Book of the year

Scott Adams's ["From 0 to 1"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4)
"How to fail at almost anything and still win big" is a must read if you
are in search of meanings.

Scott tells the story of his life and struggles: starting from the bottom till
setting up the life he enjoys.

## Movie of The Year

You might think that [King Richard](https://www.netflix.com/am/title/81252357)
is just a tribute to Williams's sisters journey and nothing more.

I just ask to not judge a movie by its cover and give it a try.

Beautiful story of struggles and dreams of Williams family and surely Will Smith's genius is going to make you speechless after watching.

## TV-Show of the year

Wednesday by Netflix is a new take on an old story seasoned with a subtle humor.

Fascinating camera work and marvelous Jenna Ortega playing the role of a young sociopath is just another level of art.

## Course of the year

[–ñ–æ–ø–∞](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfT6YSH545mZSq5OuGdBsYrUsAhGGHEhQ)
by Evan Zamesin is definitely the course of the year for me.

I think 2022 doesn't require much of a description. It's just a –ñ–æ–ø–∞.

## Achievement of the year

Driver License.

- Theory

  Just take [varord.am's](https://varord.am) course. It has everything you need to prepare.

- Driving

  Just practice and avoid fastdrive's course. Their drivers are qyart and sexist.

## Memory of the year

Leo Andr√©s Messi. World Cup. Qatar.
