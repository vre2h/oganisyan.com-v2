One might argue, that we can build a project even without them, but have you really seen those applications? ⤵️

1. They are hard to use and ugly. Developers aren’t the best people to create website maps or pick colors (most of them don’t even know about color theory, typography, layouts, etc).

2. They took a lot of time for devs to work on. To add a new page or even a modal, developers or pm’s trying and retrying to use tons of variations of different components.

3. UI libs are so similar in their ugliness. 😶

4. Developers rarely think about mobile-friendly applications. If it works on their 15” MacBooks, then everything is okay. 🤢

5. Same about accessibility.

6. Same about performance.

7. Same about tons of things. ♾

And what makes me sad the most, is that started to forget that: “Design isn't just what it looks like and feels like — design is how it works.” (Steve Jobs)

🤔 I worked with a lot of designers, most of them were not appreciated enough, because mostly we think that developers are the most important people. I’m not sure.

P.S. It's UX/UI, not UI/UX.
