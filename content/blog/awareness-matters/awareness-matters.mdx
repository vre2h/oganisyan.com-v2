If there is one truth I learned at my 24 is that awareness matters the
most: via meditation, mindfulness, or even basic breathing practices.

## why

  ] show that mindfulness practices can help you to be calmer about the
  decisions you make even under the stress, be happier and see beauty around.
</p>

Every time I bring more awareness to my life, the overall quality
of life changes.
I become happier and less stressed, I sleep much better and calmer, waking up energized
(tracking sleep and stress level via [mi band](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-smart-band-5/) or any other smart-watch can help to measure).

### rest

Most of my friends and colleagues are complaining that they don't know
how to rest.

Awareness techniques are the first steps to give yourself a better treat both
mentally and physically. They help to explore true desires and find the activities
that help you to rest.

## faq

Note, that

1. Some of the practices might sound hard at first glance, don't fall into that trap.
   Use links [bellow](#how-to) to find out more about practices for beginners and
   how to bring them to your life.
2. Spend as much time, as you feel like even if it is 5 minutes daily.
3. Regularity is key. Awareness is not a one-time thing. Don't even hope.
4. Although awareness brings calmness and joy to your life very fast,
   people with anxiety issues might wait for the results a bit longer.
