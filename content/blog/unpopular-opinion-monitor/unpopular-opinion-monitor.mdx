Unpopular Opinion: Second Monitor is overrated. You don’t agree? Let me explain why you are mistaken 👇

1️⃣ Quality

It’s almost always the difference in quality between the monitors and your eyes are going to ache because of the switching. You can argue that there’s a way to adjust the frame rate and resolution, but it brings tons of complexity itself (e.g. price).

2️⃣ No flexibility

If you are used to working with two monitors, it’s really hard to be switch back to flexible mode. So no Bali or beautiful anti-cafes.

3️⃣ Lags

Synchronization between monitors and lags every time they disconnect because of nothing is another huuuuge problem I stress every time I think of it.
