I remember a day, a few years ago, I was reading the “Deep Work” by Cal
Newport. Cal was telling about the importance of focused deep work and
how high is the cost of distraction.

The book triggered me to start being mindful of the harm notifications
Starting from that day I started to turn notifications off but in a slow mode without stressing myself and throwing myself at the feet of the FOMO.

> 🙀 FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) — fear of not being included in something (such as an interesting or enjoyable activity) that others are experiencing

So, here is my one-year plan on how to gradually disable notifications.

| **Time**    | **Easy**                                                                             | Hard                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Q1 | Turning off secondary applications (e.g. photo editing, sports)                      | ---                                   |
| Q2 | Turning off productivity apps (e.g. todoist, Trello, apple reminder)                 | Turning off Emails                    |
| Q3 | Turning off social networks (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)                      | Turning off Services (delivery, taxi) |
| Q4 | Turning off all applications except phone calls (e.g. messenger, telegram, WhatsApp) | Turning off everything                |

_The plan is flexible, so you can change it as you wish._
