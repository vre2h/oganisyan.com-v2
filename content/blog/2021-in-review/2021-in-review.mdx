2021 was a little bit chaotic cause I went through real
productive months to the ones, where I achieved nothing.

In 2021 I learnt to rest more, appreciate weekends, be more mindfull and
had my first vacation in 3 years (highly recommended).

<Timeline2021 />

## Book of the year

Peter Thiele's ["From 0 to 1"](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) is the best book I read during the year.
It tells the story behind Sillicon Valley and it's products.

Great book if you want to understand how market works and what you
should do to have a place in there.

## Application of the year

Although I found [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) a few days ago, it completely changed the
way I go to gym. No, you got it wrong, I mean mental gym, because
Headspace is a great application which helps you to live more mindful.

- Mastering and making meditation an habbit
- Letting Stress and Anxiety go
- Mindful Eating

a little list of things headspace helps you to achieve. It's like a great psychologist just in your pocket.

#### Other recommendations:

- Spotify â€” is an application which changed the way I use music. It's
  algorithms are understanding me better than any of my friends.
  In recent update, they even add lyrics and make ideal application even better.

- If you are a macOS user, then you must have [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).

  [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) is a subscription for a bunch of great services that make life easier:

  - Paste â€” smart clipboard history
  - CleanMyMac â€” emptying RAM, smart delete system, protection and many more...
  - Magnet â€” window manager you were dreaming about

- Yandex Comfort+ and Business

  During the year I decided to stop using any other than Comfort+
  and Business Plans. The Decision changed the quality of my life and experience.
  Now using taxis are not a bunch of stress anymore.

- Netflix

  As always, my big love for watching TV Shows and Movies

## Movie of The Year

[Don't Look UP](https://www.netflix.com/am/title/81252357) is an absolutely winner in the category.

Leo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence and great Meryl Streep are
hurting a little bit by showing the reality we are leaving in. Great team and even better idea behind are making "Don't look UP" the best movie I watched.

#### Other recommendations:

- Spider-Man: No Way Home
- House of Gucci
- The Mauritanian
- Dune

## TV-Show of the year

The last season of ["You"](https://www.netflix.com/am/title/80211991) was absolutely shocking for me. I was waiting
yet another development of the same problems of Joe, but this time the show was not only about one hero,
but about bunch of problems which torture modern society:

- Relationships after wedding and marriage in 2021
- Postpartum depression
- Virtual vs Real
- Falsy standards and believes

At the same time it shows that heroes wants to change and trying their best.
In the end, they fail and trying to cope with it.

#### Other recommendations:

- Money Heist
- Sex Education
- Squid Games
- Vikings

## Course of the year

[Google's Certified Project Management](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management) course is absolutely winner for me.

It consists of 6th courses which covers Project Initialization, Execution, Closing, Scrum, and even a capston.

I have completed 4/6 during the year, but even now the knowledge and
expertise I got is beyond any expectations.

The course every PM should take.

## Achievement of the year

Now I'm Master in Psychology.

- Internet addiction
- Ð¡lip Ð¡ulture
- Losing the ability to reading books
- The phenomenon of social network apps

All these topics are in the middle of my scientific interests and I
tried to research and cover them in the work.

Hopefully, the thesis will be published and available very soon so I can share it.
